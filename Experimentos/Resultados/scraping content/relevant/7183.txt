Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/MayaTPrabhu","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/mayatprabhu/","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Spelman College"},{"name":"University of Maryland"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2024-04-30T18:35:31.117Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/dd4ce7a7-fbf2-4f45-8fb2-296165ee1f32.png","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayatprabhu/","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/","expertise":"11","custom_ajc_website":"ajc","middleName":"T."}}}]},"description":{"basic":"The Georgia General Assembly begins the first of a two-year legislative session at the state Capitol Monday."},"display_date":"2025-01-13T12:00:00Z","headlines":{"basic":"The new state legislative session begins today"},"subheadlines":{"basic":"New Democratic leadership takes over as the Republican majority pushes for legislation affecting schools, youth."},"promo_items":{"basic":{"type":"video","_id":"1093d47d-ad6d-4473-9062-f0d006035d2b","version":"0.8.0","subtype":"vod","language":"en","canonical_url":"/news/video/georgia-republicans-could-revive-education-bills-on-school-chaplains-and-library-censorship/1093d47d-ad6d-4473-9062-f0d006035d2b/","canonical_website":"ajc","short_url":"/news/video/georgia-republicans-could-revive-education-bills-on-school-chaplains-and-library-censorship/1093d47d-ad6d-4473-9062-f0d006035d2b/","created_date":"2025-01-13T14:52:04Z","last_updated_date":"2025-01-13T16:15:07Z","publish_date":"2025-01-13T16:15:15Z","first_publish_date":"2025-01-13T16:15:14Z","display_date":"2025-01-13T16:15:14Z","headlines":{"basic":"What \"culture war\" bills are Georgia Republicans reviving in 2025?","meta_title":"Georgia Republicans could revive education bills on school chaplains and library censorship"},"subheadlines":{"basic":"Georgia legislators are back in session and conservative \"culture war\" bills are back on the table.
